## Features
- Convert between IFC GUIDs and UUIDs
- Convert Revit Unique IDs to IFC GUIDs
- Convert AutoCAD handles to and from IFC GUIDs
- Convert 32-bit and 64-bit integers to and from IFC GUIDs
- Convert string representations of integers to and from IFC GUIDs
- Validate Revit Unique IDs

## What are IFC GUIDs?
IFC GUIDs (Industry Foundation Classes Globally Unique Identifiers) are special 22-character identifiers used in Building Information Modeling (BIM) to uniquely identify elements across different software platforms and throughout a building's lifecycle.
This package facilitates working with these identifiers in Go applications.

## Requirements
This package is developed and tested with Go 1.22.3. It may work with earlier versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Installation
To install the `ifcguid` package, use the following command:
```shell
go get github.com/woweh/ifcguid
```

## Example
An example of how to use this package is provided in the `example_test.go` file in the root of the repository.
You can run this example using:
```shell
go test -v -run=Example
```

## Information about calculating ifcGUIDs
The calculation of ifcGUIDs is based on the following resources:
